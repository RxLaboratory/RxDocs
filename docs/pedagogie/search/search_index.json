La transmission du savoir et le partage sont une part indissociable de notre activit\u00e9, et nous avons \u00e0 coeur de toujour am\u00e9liorer notre mani\u00e8re d\u2019enseigner. Ce \u201cguide\u201d propose quelques r\u00e9flexions et pistes (sourc\u00e9es et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es) pour rendre l\u2019enseignement, et l\u2019apprentissage, le plus efficace possible. Les conseils que nous rassemblons ici sont bas\u00e9s sur diverses sources scientifiques et \u00e9tudes v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es et v\u00e9rifiables (les sources sont list\u00e9es en bas de page), ainsi que sur notre exp\u00e9rience dans l\u2019enseignement et s\u2019am\u00e9liorent au fil du temps. Il est possible que nous cassions ici quelques id\u00e9es re\u00e7ues et erreurs courantes, que nous pouvions avoir et avoir faites nous m\u00eames mais que nous corrigeons au fil du temps de mani\u00e8re empirique et aussi par nos lectures scientifiques. M\u00e9fions-nous des pr\u00e9conisations qui ne seraient pas le fruit d\u2019\u00e9tudes v\u00e9rifiables et reproductibles, de la tradition ou des jugements personnels. Note Ce document est en cours d\u2019\u00e9criture et en constante \u00e9volution. Tout le monde peut apprendre \u00c0 tout \u00e2ge, m\u00eame pass\u00e9 la vingtaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 le cerveau change de configuration pour passer d\u2019une forme extr\u00e8mement plastique \u00e0 m\u00eame d\u2019apprendre tr\u00e8s vite \u00e0 une forme plus stable permettant de fixer les notions sur le long terme, l\u2019humain a une capacit\u00e9 d\u2019apprentissage extr\u00e8mement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e. Cependant, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisant, deux attitudes peuvent se d\u00e9gager au moment d\u2019apprendre des choses complexes, qui paraissent trop difficiles : Se d\u00e9courager, se dire \u201c je n\u2019en suis pas capable, je ne suis pas assez intelligent, c\u2019est trop complexe \u201d, etc. Ou bien avoir conscience qu\u2019on aura un effort suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 faire pour y arriver. C\u2019est la deuxi\u00e8me attitude qui est, scientifiquement parlant, la plus juste 1 . Sauf cas particulier de troubles de l\u2019apprentissage, tout le monde peut apprendre, pourvu qu\u2019il y consacre un effort. 1 Quatre fonctions c\u00e9r\u00e9brales et trois \u00e9tapes de m\u00e9morisation L\u2019attention et l\u2019encodage de l\u2019information L\u2019attention, la concentration, met en oeuvre un ensemble de circuits neuronaux qui amplifient l\u2019information sur laquelle nous nous concentrons et d\u00e9cuplent la profondeur de l\u2019apprentissage. 1 L\u2019attention favorise la premi\u00e8re phase de la m\u00e9morisation, l\u2019encodage , en permettant un traitement de l\u2019information en profondeur ; il faut comprendre l\u2019information et pouvoir la mettre en relation avec ce que l\u2019on sait d\u00e9j\u00e0. De la part de l\u2019eseignant, tout ce qui favorise l\u2019attention des \u00e9tudiants est bon \u00e0 prendre : voix qui porte, motivation, \u00e9nergie. Les variations de rythme, l\u2019humour ou les anecdotes sont par exemple efficaces pour (re)capter l\u2019attention des \u00e9tudiants. Hint Si peu d\u2019\u00e9tudes ont \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le rire, on sait qu\u2019il favorise grandement l\u2019apprentissage, des enfants aussi bien que des adultes, probablement en favorisant l\u2019attention et en renfor\u00e7ant le lien social avec l\u2019enseignant. Transmettre les notions avec humour est tr\u00e8s efficace. Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tudiant, tout ce qui d\u00e9tourne l\u2019attention du sujet est \u00e0 proscrire absolument, aussi bien en phase d\u2019apprentissage (cours magistral, exercices\u2026) que de travail personnel : garder une source de distraction comme, par exemple, une vid\u00e9o dans un coin de l\u2019\u00e9cran, ou le fait d\u2019\u00eatre trop r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement d\u00e9rang\u00e9 par quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, a syst\u00e9matiquement un impact n\u00e9gatif sur la concentration et donc sur l\u2019assimilation et l\u2019apprentissage. Le cerveau est bien plus efficace quand toute son attention est concentr\u00e9e sur une t\u00e2che unique. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, tout ce qui favorise la concentration est bon \u00e0 prendre : les pauses de temps en temps aident \u00e0 se reconcentrer en revenant au travail, pour certains le fait d\u2019\u00e9couter de la musique am\u00e9liore la concentration (notamment en s\u2019isolant des distractions du reste de la salle)\u2026 L\u2019engagement actif Un cerveau passif n\u2019apprend rien. Pour r\u00e9ussir, il doit sans arr\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9rer activement des hypoth\u00e8ses avec la curiosit\u00e9 comme moteur. 1 L\u2019enseignant doit \u00e0 tout prix favoriser cette curiosit\u00e9 et pousser \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion : poser des questions, favoriser les int\u00e9ractions\u2026 La taille du groupe auquel on enseigne est primordial : un trop grand groupe rend rapidement l\u2019enseignement tr\u00e8s passif, limite l\u2019engagement des participants ; \u00e0 l\u2019inverse un cours particulier peut parfois aussi limiter un certain engagement nait de la confrontation des id\u00e9es entre plusieurs \u00e9tudiants. On pr\u00e9f\u00e8rera donc, dans la mesure du possible, des petits groupes, de moins de 10 \u00e9tudiants(voire moins de 5), ou diviser les classes (plut\u00f4t que d\u2019enseigner \u00e0 toute la classe, diviser en plusieurs groupes : pendant que l\u2019un fait un exercice ou un test, l\u2019autre suit un cours magistral, et inversement\u2026). L\u2019\u00e9tudiant doit se forcer \u00e0 participer activement au cours et pas simplement \u00e9couter et prendre des notes. Si les notes peuvent souvent \u00eatre utiles, elles peuvent aussi \u00eare contre-productives en favorisant une certaine passivit\u00e9 par exemple. L\u2019enseignant aura tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 donner aux \u00e9tudiants un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis par \u00e9crit (et illustr\u00e9) de son cours pour leur \u00e9viter d\u2019avoir \u00e0 prendre des notes et ainsi leur permettre de suivre activement le cours. Le retour sur erreur Il faut comparer nos pr\u00e9dictions avec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, d\u00e9dramatiser et se corriger. 1 Dans le cas d\u2019un enseignement technique, mais aussi th\u00e9orique, les exercices et la mise en pratique sont particuli\u00e8rement importants : l\u2019\u00e9tudiant doit pouvoir essayer, se tromper, rater pour pouvoir \u00eatre corrig\u00e9 et qu\u2019on lui explique ses erreurs. C\u2019est ce qui fait notamment l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9-tests (voir chapitre sur la M\u00e9thodologie ). La consolidation et la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition des notions, entrecoup\u00e9es de p\u00e9riodes de sommeil, notre cerveau transf\u00e8re ses acquis dans la m\u00e9moire \u00e0 long terme, c\u2019est la consolidation, qui permet d\u2019automatiser les notions et de lib\u00e9rer les ressources intellectuelles pour d\u2019autres objectifs. 1 C\u2019est la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition qui permet de consolider la m\u00e9morisation ; la consolidation est la deuxi\u00e8me phase de m\u00e9morisation. La consolidation est maximis\u00e9e par l\u2019effet d\u2019espacement et la r\u00e9pition espac\u00e9e des notions 4 (voir ci-dessous le chapitre M\u00e9thodologie ). Elle n\u2019est efficace que si des p\u00e9riodes de sommeil de qualit\u00e9 ont lieu entre les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions. L\u2019effet d\u2019espacement est le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne selon lequel la m\u00e9morisation sur le long terme est sup\u00e9rieure quand une m\u00eame dur\u00e9e d\u2019apprentissage est espac\u00e9e dans le temps, plut\u00f4t que concentr\u00e9e en une seule session. La pratique de la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition espac\u00e9e est ainsi sup\u00e9rieure au bachotage pour un apprentissage sur le long terme. La multiplication des modes de reproduction (quiz, reformulation, questionnements, \u2026) fait aussi l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la consolidation (voir ci dessous). Cette consolidation est aussi grandement favoris\u00e9e et amplifi\u00e9e par la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration , la troisi\u00e8me phase de la m\u00e9morisation. Le fait de chercher et faire appel \u00e0 l\u2019information, notamment en se testant, am\u00e9liore la r\u00e9tention de l\u2019information \u00e0 long terme (voir la section Effet Test du chapitre M\u00e9thodologie ). Les ennemis de l\u2019apprentissage Le manque de sommeil Le sommeil est un processus clef de la consolidation de l\u2019apprentissage ; si les besoins de chacun varient, la grande majorit\u00e9 des adultes ne peut pas se passer d\u2019un minimum de 7h de sommeil toutes les 24h au moins. Le manque de sommeil ou le mauvais sommeil, tout en ayant un impact n\u00e9gatif sur la consolidation, r\u00e9duira aussi l\u2019attention et l\u2019engagement actif, et aura donc aussi un impact n\u00e9gatif d\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception des information et l\u2019encodage. L\u2019ennui et la distraction L\u2019ennui et la distraction sont les premi\u00e8res causes de perte d\u2019attention et d\u2019engagement actif. Comme d\u00e9taill\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019enseignant doit tout faire pour luter contre l\u2019ennui , et l\u2019\u00e9tudiant doit se couper de toute source de distraction d\u00e8s qu\u2019il est en phase d\u2019apprentissage ou de travail personnel. Les \u00e9crans Des \u00e9tudes montrent que le traitement de l\u2019information lue sur un \u00e9cran est moins profond que sur papier. Enseignant, \u00e9tudiants, imprimez vos documents importants pour se d\u00e9tourner autant que possible des \u00e9crans ! Quoiqu\u2019il en soit, des notes sur papier sont toujours plus pratiques au moment d\u2019appliquer un savoir faire sur un outil informatique. L\u2019apprentissage par la d\u00e9couverte Certains enseignants ou p\u00e9dagogues pr\u00e9conisent parfois de laisser \u00e0 leurs \u00e9tudiants une phase de recherche personnelle, de d\u00e9couverte, avant de leur apporter leur enseignement, laissant l\u2019\u00e9tudiant face \u00e0 un contenu pour qu\u2019il explore. Cela ne fonctionne pas. Si \u00e7a peut parfois \u00eatre un outil de plus pour anticiper un cours, en pr\u00e9paration, m\u00eame dans ce cas il ne faut pas en surestimer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. L\u2019interaction avec un enseignant est cruciale - ne serait-ce que parce qu\u2019il est le plus \u00e0 m\u00eame de favoriser l\u2019attention et l\u2019engagement actif. Il ne faut pas confondre cet apprentissage par la d\u00e9couverte avec un pr\u00e9-test (voir chapitre suivant), o\u00f9 l\u2019apprentissage suit le test et o\u00f9 toutes les notions sont expliqu\u00e9es (le pr\u00e9-test ne remplace pas l\u2019enseignement, il en renforce l\u2019efficacit\u00e9). M\u00e9thodologie R\u00e9p\u00e9tition C\u2019est le fait de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter qui permet la m\u00e9morisation \u00e0 long terme, pourvu que les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions s\u2019espacent de plus en plus (voir sections suivantes). Il ne faut pas avoir peur de recommencer, encore et encore, c\u2019est la mani\u00e8re naturelle qu\u2019a le cerveau pour apprendre. Tous les musiciens le savent par exemple : c\u2019est \u00e0 force de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter un morceau qu\u2019on finit par le ma\u00eetriser (on n\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs pas peur en musique de confondre les mots apprentissage , pr\u00e9paration et r\u00e9p\u00e9tition ). Tant qu\u2019un exercice n\u2019est pas ma\u00eetris\u00e9, il faut le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter en corrigeant ses erreurs, qui ne sont pas toujours les m\u00eames. La correction d\u2019une erreur peut en amener d\u2019autres, il faut alors encore recommencer. Faire un exercice une seule fois pour conclure \u201c C\u2019est bon je l\u2019ai fait \u201d n\u2019est pas efficace. Il faut faire et refaire ; chaque redite sera meilleure et gravera les notions et le savoir faire dans la m\u00e9moire c\u00e9r\u00e9brale. Effet d\u2019espacement L\u2019effet d\u2019espacement est le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne selon lequel la m\u00e9morisation sur le long terme est sup\u00e9rieure quand une m\u00eame dur\u00e9e d\u2019apprentissage est espac\u00e9e dans le temps, plut\u00f4t que concentr\u00e9e en une seule session. La pratique de la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition espac\u00e9e est ainsi sup\u00e9rieure au bachotage pour un apprentissage sur le long terme. Des \u00e9tudes montrent que l\u2019effet d\u2019espacement est important dans l\u2019\u00e9ducation et produit des gains significatifs, en particulier quand l\u2019espacement se compte en jours ou semaines 2 . Cet espacement permet en outre de m\u00e9langer les sujets , et l\u00e0 aussi des \u00e9tudes montrent que la m\u00e9morisation peut \u00eatre meilleure dans ce cas 3 . Il semble que le m\u00e9lange des probl\u00e8mes aide l\u2019apprenant \u00e0 apprendre \u00e0 s\u00e9lectionner plus facilement la solution d\u2019un probl\u00e8me sp\u00e9cifique, alors que si les solutions sont enseign\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re \u201ctri\u00e9e\u201d ou group\u00e9e, l\u2019apprenant aura plus de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 s\u00e9lectionner le savoir utile dans une situation sp\u00e9cifique parmi tout ce qu\u2019il a appris. Il apparait donc qu\u2019il est plus efficace d\u2019espacer l\u2019enseignement et de l\u2019alterner les sujets plut\u00f4t que de regrouper les enseignements; au niveau de l\u2019organisation du planning, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d\u2019avoir des cours r\u00e9guliers mais espac\u00e9s qui s\u2019alternent, et au sein d\u2019un cours en particulier, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d\u2019alterner les notions plut\u00f4t que de les enseigner en bloc l\u2019une apr\u00e8s l\u2019autre 4 . L\u2019espacement des r\u00e9p\u00e9titions de l\u2019enseignement peut aller grandissant ; ainsi, sur les premiers enseignements des notions, un espace de 24h avant une premi\u00e8re r\u00e9p\u00e9tition est id\u00e9al (laissant une p\u00e9riode de sommeil favorisant la consolidation), puis ensuite quelques jours, quelques semaines, etc. Les notions se fixent alors efficacement dans la m\u00e9moire \u00e0 long terme. \u00c9videmment, toutes les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions n\u2019ont pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 \u00eatre prises en main par l\u2019enseignant, qui pourra se limiter \u00e0 quelques r\u00e9p\u00e9titions de temps en temps, mais c\u2019est l\u2019apprenant qui doit aussi organiser de lui m\u00eame des r\u00e9p\u00e9titions, des r\u00e9visions : refaire des exercices, relire, se tester (\u00e0 plusieurs, voir section suivante sur l\u2019 effet test ), mettre en pratique\u2026 Effet test L\u2019effet test est le corolaire de la R\u00e9cup\u00e9ration , troisi\u00e8me phase de la m\u00e9morisation \u00e0 long terme : en faisant appel aux informations que l\u2019on est en train d\u2019apprendre, on renforce leur m\u00e9morisation. Plut\u00f4t que de relire, revoir, r\u00e9-\u00e9couter, il est bien plus efficace de aussi se tester : questions, jeux, et toute m\u00e9thode permettant de mettre en oeuvre le processus de la r\u00e9cup\u00e9ration , de faire appel \u00e0 la notion d\u00e9j\u00e0 apprise, aidera \u00e0 la fixer sur le long terme. Les tests les plus efficaces sont les tests difficiles mais r\u00e9ussis . Si les tests sont trop difficiles (on les rate tous) ou non-accompagn\u00e9s (il n\u2019y a personne pour rappeler / r\u00e9-expliquer), ou \u00e0 l\u2019inverse si ils sont trop faciles (on n\u2019a pas \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir), ils perdent leur efficacit\u00e9. Un moyen de doser la difficulit\u00e9 est de moduler l\u2019espacement entre l\u2019apprentissage, les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions et les tests (voir section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente sur l\u2019 effet d\u2019espacement ) 5 . La forme des tests importe peu, l\u2019important \u00e9tant de faire un appel aux connaissances : quiz, QCM, jeux, exercices d\u2019application, tout est efficace ; en notant la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 pouvant renforcer l\u2019attention et la motivation. Pr\u00e9-tests Il est montr\u00e9 que les tests peuvent pr\u00e9c\u00e9der l\u2019enseignement , qui a alors pour r\u00f4le d\u2019apporter les r\u00e9ponses aux questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9es. Les \u00e9tudes montrent que cette m\u00e9thode renforce l\u2019enseignement qui suit et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des tests ult\u00e9rieurs. 6 Un exercice pratique, un questionnaire, un jeu, peuvent alors pr\u00e9c\u00e9der l\u2019enseignement th\u00e9orique pour en renforcer la m\u00e9morisation. Alimentation Il va de soit que pour bien apprendre, il faut \u00eatre en bonne sant\u00e9, et donc avoir une alimentation \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e. Cela \u00e9tant rappel\u00e9, voici en particulier les besoins c\u00e9r\u00e9braux. Le cerveau a besoin d\u2019un apport constant en glucides, il consomme l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019un morceau de sucre chaque heure. Le taux de glyc\u00e9mie est ainsi tr\u00e8s important pour maintenir sa concentration et son activit\u00e9. L\u2019apport constant et r\u00e9gulier en glucose est assur\u00e9 par les aliments \u00e0 taux glyc\u00e9mique bas : les l\u00e9gumineuses (pois chiches, lentilles, haricots blancs et rouges\u2026) et les c\u00e9r\u00e9ales compl\u00e8tes (riz, p\u00e2tes, orge, pain au levain\u2026) consomm\u00e9s matin, midi et soir. Les deux repas de la journ\u00e9e (matin et midi) permettent de maintenit le taux de glyc\u00e9mie tout au long de la journ\u00e9e de travail, les glucides du repas du soir (p\u00e2tes, riz, pomme de terre) permettant la consolidation. Un apport en prot\u00e9ines (v\u00e9g\u00e9tales - l\u00e9gumineuses et c\u00e9r\u00e9ales - ou animales - lait, viande et poisson) est aussi n\u00e9cessaire pour entretenir le cerveau. L\u2019apport en om\u00e9ga-3 ( poissons gras - sardine, anchois, saumon, thon\u2026 - et certaines huiles - huile de lin, huile de chanvre, huile de colza\u2026) sont aussi essentiels \u00e0 la fabrication et au fonctionnement des neurones. En n\u2019oubliant pas que le corps a aussi besoin d\u2019omega-6 et omega-9 (\u00e0 ce titre, l\u2019huile de colza est une des plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9es de toutes). Attention, le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des huiles est vite perdu avec la chaleur (donc la cuisson) qui d\u00e9truit ces mol\u00e9cules. Enfin, les vitamines et en particulier la vitamine A sont tr\u00e8s importantes (carottes, courges, \u00e9pinards, beurre\u2026) (avec l\u2019\u00e2ge, l\u2019apport de vitamine A permet de pr\u00e9venir le d\u00e9clin cognitif), mais aussi les vitamines B1 (avoine, germe de bl\u00e9, foie\u2026) et B9 (noix, ch\u00e2taignes, pois chiches\u2026). Exemple fictif d\u2019un cours parfait En guise de r\u00e9sum\u00e9, voici un cours fictif qui se d\u00e9roule dans des conditions id\u00e9ales. Au d\u00e9but du cours, le groupe d\u2019une dizaine d\u2019\u00e9tudiants (ou une classe de 20 divis\u00e9e en deux) arrive. Ils ont bien dormi (au moins 7 ou 8 heures), ils n\u2019ont pas faim, sont en forme et mangent tous \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Un groupe relativement petit, le sommeil, l\u2019alimentation, sont la base indispensable \u00e0 une bonne transmission du savoir. La journ\u00e9e commence par un test (un quiz/QCM) reprenant les notions \u00e9tudi\u00e9es la veille, d\u2019une dur\u00e9e comprise entre 30 minutes et une heure. \u00c0 la fin de l\u2019exercice, l\u2019enseignant reprend les questions et redonne les explications n\u00e9cessaires. On profite de l\u2019effet test et de l\u2019effet d\u2019espacement pour renforcer les notions enseign\u00e9es. En commen\u00e7ant la journ\u00e9e activement, on renforce l\u2019attention et l\u2019engagement des \u00e9tudiants, potentiellement encore en phase de r\u00e9veil\u2026 En deuxi\u00e8me partie de matin\u00e9e, l\u2019enseignant enseigne de nouvelles notions ; il le fait avec \u00e9nergie et humour, bien s\u00fbr. L\u2019enseignant prend soin de garder l\u2019attention des \u00e9tudiants, et de favoriser leur engagement, par exemple en posant des questions, en montrant des r\u00e9sultats et exemples int\u00e9ressants, etc. Mise en application des notions enseign\u00e9es avant la (courte) pause, court exercice pratique.

Cela \u00e9tant rappel\u00e9, voici en particulier les besoins c\u00e9r\u00e9braux. Le cerveau a besoin d\u2019un apport constant en glucides, il consomme l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019un morceau de sucre chaque heure. Le taux de glyc\u00e9mie est ainsi tr\u00e8s important pour maintenir sa concentration et son activit\u00e9. L\u2019apport constant et r\u00e9gulier en glucose est assur\u00e9 par les aliments \u00e0 taux glyc\u00e9mique bas : les l\u00e9gumineuses (pois chiches, lentilles, haricots blancs et rouges\u2026) et les c\u00e9r\u00e9ales compl\u00e8tes (riz, p\u00e2tes, orge, pain au levain\u2026) consomm\u00e9s matin, midi et soir. Les deux repas de la journ\u00e9e (matin et midi) permettent de maintenit le taux de glyc\u00e9mie tout au long de la journ\u00e9e de travail, les glucides du repas du soir (p\u00e2tes, riz, pomme de terre) permettant la consolidation. Un apport en prot\u00e9ines (v\u00e9g\u00e9tales - l\u00e9gumineuses et c\u00e9r\u00e9ales - ou animales - lait, viande et poisson) est aussi n\u00e9cessaire pour entretenir le cerveau. L\u2019apport en om\u00e9ga-3 ( poissons gras - sardine, anchois, saumon, thon\u2026 - et certaines huiles - huile de lin, huile de chanvre, huile de colza\u2026) sont aussi essentiels \u00e0 la fabrication et au fonctionnement des neurones. En n\u2019oubliant pas que le corps a aussi besoin d\u2019omega-6 et omega-9 (\u00e0 ce titre, l\u2019huile de colza est une des plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9es de toutes). Attention, le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des huiles est vite perdu avec la chaleur (donc la cuisson) qui d\u00e9truit ces mol\u00e9cules. Enfin, les vitamines et en particulier la vitamine A sont tr\u00e8s importantes (carottes, courges, \u00e9pinards, beurre\u2026) (avec l\u2019\u00e2ge, l\u2019apport de vitamine A permet de pr\u00e9venir le d\u00e9clin cognitif), mais aussi les vitamines B1 (avoine, germe de bl\u00e9, foie\u2026) et B9 (noix, ch\u00e2taignes, pois chiches\u2026).","title":"Alimentation"},{"location":"index.html#exemple-fictif-dun-cours-parfait","text":"En guise de r\u00e9sum\u00e9, voici un cours fictif qui se d\u00e9roule dans des conditions id\u00e9ales.

PREAMBLE The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \u201ccopyleft\u201d, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document\u2019s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document\u2019s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \u201cHistory\u201d section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d or \u201cDedications\u201d, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\u2019s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d; likewise combine any sections Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, and any sections Entitled \u201cDedications\u201d. You must delete all sections Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document\u2019s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\u201d (or \u201cMMC Site\u201d) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration\u201d (or \u201cMMC\u201d) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \u201cCC-BY-SA\u201d means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \u201cIncorporate\u201d means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \u201celigible for relicensing\u201d if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.","title":"Gfdl"},{"location":"licenses/gfdl.html#gnu-free-documentation-license","text":"Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU Free Documentation License"},{"location":"licenses/gfdl.html#0-preamble","text":"The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.

Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.","title":"1.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B.

Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers\u2019 and authors\u2019 protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u2019 and authors\u2019 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\u2019 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. \u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cLicensees\u201d and \u201crecipients\u201d may be individuals or organizations. To \u201cmodify\u201d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \u201cmodified version\u201d of the earlier work or a work \u201cbased on\u201d the earlier work. A \u201ccovered work\u201d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. The \u201csource code\u201d for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \u201cObject code\u201d means any non-source form of a work. A \u201cStandard Interface\u201d means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \u201cSystem Libraries\u201d of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \u201cMajor Component\u201d, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \u201cCorresponding Source\u201d for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work\u2019s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users\u2019 Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\u2019s users, your or third parties\u2019 legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\u2019s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \u201ckeep intact all notices\u201d. c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \u201cUser Product\u201d is either (1) a \u201cconsumer product\u201d, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \u201cnormally used\u201d refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \u201cInstallation Information\u201d for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. \u201cAdditional permissions\u201d are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u201cfurther restrictions\u201d within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \u201centity transaction\u201d is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party\u2019s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. A \u201ccontributor\u201d is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor\u2019s \u201ccontributor version\u201d. A contributor\u2019s \u201cessential patent claims\u201d are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \u201ccontrol\u201d includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor\u2019s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \u201cpatent license\u201d is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \u201cgrant\u201d such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \u201cKnowingly relying\u201d means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient\u2019s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others\u2019 Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \u201ccopyright\u201d line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w\u2019 and `show c\u2019 should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program\u2019s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \u201cabout box\u201d. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \u201ccopyright disclaimer\u201d for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html .","title":"Gnu gpl"},{"location":"licenses/gnu-gpl.html#gnu-general-public-license","text":"Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"},{"location":"licenses/gnu-gpl.html#preamble","text":"The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers\u2019 and authors\u2019 protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\u2019 and authors\u2019 sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\u2019 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"licenses/gnu-gpl.html#terms-and-conditions","text":"","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},{"location":"licenses/gnu-gpl.html#0-definitions","text":"\u201cThis License\u201d refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
