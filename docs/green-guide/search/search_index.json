File size. One media file may be small. We could even consider that all our media files are not so big after all, compared to all the data stored in the world. But let\u2019s not forget video is the biggest part of the traffic on the internet, and even a very small decrease in the average video file size could save a lot both in storage and bandwidth. Decoding performance A media file is meant to be played. And most of the time, the goal is for it to be played by as many people as possible. If the format is easier to decode, in terms of performance and bandwidth, that means less energy consumption to play it, and could save a lot of energy worldwide. Encoding performance This is much less important compared to the two previous points, as it happens just a few times in the lifetime of a media file, but it consumes much more power than decoding, so whenever possible, it would be good to reduce encoding times and consumption. One of the easiest way is to be able to re-render only part of the video when making changes. What the file will be used for The needs for editing a media file, streaming it or screening it are different. When choosing the best format and adjusting decoding performance, we have to take the target and use into account. Note Of course, the following recommendations are just guidelines. You may need to improve quality depending on your specific needs durint the production; the goal of this document is to show you which parameter you could tweak to try to reduce your impact on the environment.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"index.html#the-green-guide-to-transccoding","text":"When it comes to digital goods, we tend to forget too easily that they have an ecological impact, as well as any physical good.

YUV 422 Reducing the size of chroma channels can save a lot of space without impacting the decoding performance. If you don\u2019t need chroma keying, why not use a 422 format as soon as possible in the production, considering the video will be in 420 in the end? 10 bits Television standards are made for bigger and often better screens, sometimes capable of HDR colors. You may need to keep 10- or 12-bit channels, but keeping this parameter as low as possible is better. HD / 2K Will there be so many people watching this video on a huge screen, and close enough to it to see the difference if the video is in 4K and contains 4 times more data? Is it really worth it?","title":"Television or HDR screens"},{"location":"intermediary.html#cinema","text":"Intra-Frame Decoding has to be very efficient as when working on the file you have to be able to jump at any point in time. It is better to use either an file sequence, or a video using an intra-frame encoding. Lossy Do you really need a lossless format, or can you afford a theoretical loss of data, considering you won\u2019t see the difference? RGB or YUV 444 Your media is meant to be screened on huge screens, it is not recommended to reduce the size of chroma channels. 16 bits The final export has to be delivered with at least 16 bits of data per channel, and the final DCP file uses 12 bits of data. Very often people use 32-bit intermediary files, but do you real need this insane amount of colors? HD / 2K or 4K? Don\u2019t you agree that most of the people in cinemas won\u2019t see any difference between 2K and 4K? Do you even notice the difference? Does your theater even screen 4K films, have they changed their expensive projectors when 4K was made available? Is this slight difference really worth it compared to the environmental impact of files 4 times bigger? Is entertainment really that important?","title":"Cinema"},{"location":"intermediary.html#recommended-formats","text":"h.265 Intra-frame mp4, 8-bit YUV 422 will achieve all of the above points, and the resulting file size can be quite small, while being very easy to decode. It can use a lossless compression if you need, and you could also use all chroma data with a 444 encoding if you need. You can also increase to 10- or 12-bit channels. The only caveat is that it is not a frame sequence, so you won\u2019t be able to easily re-render only part of the video. Use only for short videos. If your software can\u2019t encode or decode h.265 , try with intra-frame h.264 (AVC-Intra) . OpenEXR sequence, 16-bit RGB, Luma/Chroma, DWAA Compression can achieve very small files. The Luma/Chroma option is equivalent to a 422 chroma sub-sampling and also saves space without perceptible loss. If you need chroma key in the next step you could just omit the option. DWAA compression is an efficient lossless or lossy compression, and even when lossy the loss can still be imperceptible.","title":"Recommended formats"},{"location":"intermediary.html#formats-to-avoid","text":"Prores and DnxHD/HR , although very common, are not that great. They are lossy intra-frame formats, but resulting file sizes are huge. You can have better quality and the same decoding performance with smaller intra-frame h.265 or openEXR files. PNG is nice, but openEXR is better. With the right compression settings, openEXR files can be smaller or at least the same size, and at least Adobe After Effects is much more performant for encoding and decoding openEXR . OpenEXR can be both lossy or lossless. Not Intra-frame formats such as standard h.264 for example, as this introduces a non-negligeable computing overhead while scrolling in the video file when working.","title":"Formats to avoid"}]}
